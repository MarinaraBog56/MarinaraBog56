- Hi, I’m @MarinaraBog56.
  - I'm in the final year of my PhD in astronomy at the University of Sussex. 
  - I look at the Large-Scale Structure of the Universe and its matter power spectrum.
  - I'm proficient in C++ and Python.
- I’m interested in developing a broad range of software development skills in challenging new environments.
  - I'm using github to help develop those skills and show what I've been up to!
  - I'm also interested in D&D.
- I’m currently learning how difficult it is to write a PhD thesis.
  - Having recently made the decision to move from academia to software development, I'm making my code readily available in a public space.
  - This includes both academic and personal coding projects.
- I’m looking to collaborate on... whatever really!
  - My PhD codes are on here so they don't get lost in time. Please build on them!
  - My personal coding projects are here to help me build my coding skills, so help is always appreciated!
